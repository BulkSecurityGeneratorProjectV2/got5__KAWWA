<p>Use this component for your main site navigation.</p>
<p>This component can have two levels of navigation (via a dropdown menu) and it is fully responsive.</p>

<p>Notice that, on the demo here below, you will see how the menu will look like depending 
on the size of your browser's window or device.</p>

<p><strong>Don't forget to check and adjust, if necessary, the level of the header (h tag)</strong>. 
	You may use <a href="http://gsnedders.html5.org/outliner/">The HTML5 Outliner</a> 
	to check and finetune your document outline.</p>
