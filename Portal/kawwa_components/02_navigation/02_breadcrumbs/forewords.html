<p>Breadcrumbs typically appear horizontally across the top of a web page, usually below title bars or headers. 
	They provide links back from the current page to its parent ones, following the hierarchical site structure.</p>
	
<p><strong>Don't forget to check and adjust, if necessary, the level of the header (h tag)</strong></p>
