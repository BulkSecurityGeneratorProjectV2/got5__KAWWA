<p>The "skip navigation link" is a hidden link (<strong>that's why there's nothing to see in the demo here after</strong>) 
	that allows users of screen-readers to jump directly to the page content without having to "listen" to 
	all the menu sections everytime they arrive to a new page.</p>
<p>This component also allows the skip link to be revealed when it gains focus, helping also keyboard users to jump menus.</p>
<p>Just add this component before every navigation menu.</p>
