<p>A treeview can be used to display and navigate through heavy, deep <strong>hierarchical</strong> information.</p>
<p>"...It makes sense to use a treeview, no matter how tempting it may be, only in the case where what is being represented is 
	"naturally" thought of as a hierarchy (such as a family tree). Using a treeview to represent arbitrary objects organized 
	in an arbitrary fashion at the whim of a programmer is asking for big trouble when it comes to usability." (Alan Cooper, <em>"About Face"</em>)</p>
