<p>
	Tapestry kawwa components also has an advanced AJAX based tree.
	It's actually based on the default tapestry Tree component (since 5.3).
	But since it's been created in tapestry-kawwa-component, you can also use it with tapestry 5.2.6. 
	Parameters are the same, the only thing that changes is the javascript client side implementation (based on jquery) and the generated DOM (in order to be consider kawwa recommendations).
