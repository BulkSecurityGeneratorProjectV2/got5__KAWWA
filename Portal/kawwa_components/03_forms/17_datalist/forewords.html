<p>This is a simple input pattern that doesn't require a CSS class.</p>
<p>The datalist HTML5 element, refered by the <code>list</code> attribute, is a handy and straightforward way to 
<q>list predefined options suggested to the user</q>. </p>

It doesn't mean, however, that the user is stuck with one of the values listed, but 
	that she has a simple helper to fill out the field.</p>
