<p>After form validation, the input fields that present an error will be highlighted along
with a contextual error message.</p>
<p>
    The "aria-describedby" attribute should be present only in the case of an error message.
    This attribute must be the id of the error message, present in the <code>"k-contextual-error"</code> element.
