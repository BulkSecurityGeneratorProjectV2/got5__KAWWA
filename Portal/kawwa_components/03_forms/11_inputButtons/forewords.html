<p>Form actions may be performed by an input tag of one of the following types:</p>
<ul>
	<li>type "submit"</li>
	<li>type "reset"</li>
	<li>type "button"</li>
	<li>type "image"</li>
</ul>
<p>Optional actions (positive actions other than the main validation action) are indicated by giving to the "submit" or "button" 
input tags the "optional" class.</p>
<p>You may choose to structure all input buttons in a specific container. The class ".k-buttons-bar" allows you to design a 
<code>fieldset</code> or a <code>div</code> to correctly position the group of buttons in your form.</p>
<p>Mouseover the buttons to check "<strong>:hover</strong>" styles</p>
