<p>
	When your Tapestry Form will have fail, the Kawwa library will automatically
	add the CSS classes to the fields with error. 
</p>
<p>
	For a Radio or a Checkbox, the <strong>k-field-error</strong> will be added to each label 
	element. The block displaying the error message should be added by yourself, according to 
	the Kawwa2 specifications. For retrieving the error message of a specific field, you should inject
	the form component, and use the getDefaultTracker().getError(myComponent) method.
