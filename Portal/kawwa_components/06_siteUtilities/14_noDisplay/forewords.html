<p>The "no display" component is a hidden HTML element (<strong>that's why there's nothing to see in the demo below</strong>) that's still 
	readable by screen readers or parsed by document outliners.</p>
<p>While the <code>k-skip</code> component contains a link that allows screen reader and keyboard users to jump navigation, this component should be used to hide 
	text that are visually redundant in the context where it is found. For example, in a tab section, the section header is needed to keep the logical structure of 
	the document but, at the same time,	it's value will be the same as the tab title, causing visual redundancy. In this case, you can hide the section header from display while 
	allowing it to be accessible by assistive technologies that may need this information.</p>
