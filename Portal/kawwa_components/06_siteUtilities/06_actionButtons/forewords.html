<p>Action buttons may be used for all kinds of actions that happen outside a form.</p>
<p>Here below we present some optional buttons with icons, but you may create action buttons with only text 
&emdash; by not specifying a class for the button &endash; or icon only buttons by adding the class "icon-only" 
to the component.</p>
<p>We present with this component an example of action for the print button.</p>
<p>For a series of actions, you may want to put the list of buttons inside an "action buttons bar" component.</p>
