<p>Breadcrumbs typically appear horizontally across the top of a web page, usually below title bars or headers. 
	They provide links back from the current page to its parent ones, following the hierarchical site structure.</p>

<p>Remember to <strong>adjust the level of the title</strong> to the structure of your document 
	(use <a href="http://gsnedders.html5.org/outliner/">The HTML5 Outliner</a> 
	to check and finetune your document outline).</p>
