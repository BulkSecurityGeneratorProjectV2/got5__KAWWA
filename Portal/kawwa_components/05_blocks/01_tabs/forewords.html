<p>Tab navigation is one of the most successful metaphors we can find in web interface and it is widely used today.</p>
<p>In spite of being user-friendly, there are some few points you should consider before using tabs:</p>
<ul>
	<li>tabbed structures should be used to alternate between views <strong>within the same context</strong> (the user can easily identify a distinct group of content)</li>
	<li>tabs are a <strong>parellel navigation</strong> in nature (the content of each tab share a same level of content type)</li>
	<li><strong>tab labels should be short</strong>, so they can be easily scannable</li>
	<li>as to any other form of navigation, <strong>avoid having too much tab entries</strong> (a maximum of nine tabs would be acceptable)</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that each tab section is tagged with the <code>section</code> element, and therefore with 
	an associated title. You should adjust the level of the title based on your the structure of your document(use <a href="http://gsnedders.html5.org/outliner/">The HTML5 Outliner</a> 
	in order to check and finetune the outline of your document).</p>

<p>In this snippet we've hidden the section titles with the "k-no-display" class to avoid visual repetitions with 
	the associated tab title, but it has to be present in the source code.</p>
