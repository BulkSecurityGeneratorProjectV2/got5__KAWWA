<p>"DataTables" key features are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Variable length pagination</li>
	<li>On-the-fly filtering</li>
	<li>multi-column sorting</li>
	<li>Multiple data sources display</li>
</ul>
<p>
	For more informations about how to translate the DataTable plug-in, please visit <a href="http://datatables.net/plug-ins/i18n">the official documentation</a>.
</p>
<p>Please take note that, altough very powerful and solid, <strong>this plug-in is not fully accessible</strong> (no ARIA scripting, no alternative aids, etc.) and it should not be used in a web project 
	without taking those limits into account.</p>
<p>The main reason for adding it to our Kawwa2 components is that we've been informed that the plug-in are evolving and it will be make fully accessible. In the meantime, please consider 
	carefully before using it.</p>
