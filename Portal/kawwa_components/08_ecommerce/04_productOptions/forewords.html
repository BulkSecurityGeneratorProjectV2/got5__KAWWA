<p>The Product Options component allows the user to choose between different values for a certain product's option. In the HTML plain code hereafter, we give 
	the example of the size and color of the product, but you can use the component to whatever option your product may present.</p>
<p>Notice that the HTML of this component relies on radio buttons, therefore <strong>it must appear inside a form tag</strong>.</p>
