<p>The Product Options component allows the user to choose between different values for a certain 
product's option. In the HTML markup hereafter, we give 
	the example of the size and color of the product, but you can use the component to whatever 
	option your product may present.</p>
<p>Notice that this component relies on radio buttons.</p>
