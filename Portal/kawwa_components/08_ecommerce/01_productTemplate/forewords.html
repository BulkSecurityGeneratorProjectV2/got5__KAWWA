<p>The "Product template" (which can be copied here below) groups most of the identifiable product data (based on the current 
		"hproduct" microformat specifications), independently of the type of product you're displaying :</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Product title</li>
				<li>Product category</li>
				<li>Main picture</li>
		        <li>Extras (new/promo)</li>
		        <li>Product description</li>
		        <li>Product info</li>
		        <li>Availability</li>
		        <li>Rating</li>
		        <li>Discount info</li>
		        <li>Old Price/Price data</li>
		        <li>Add to basket link</li>
			</ul>
<p>The order in which the product data appear in the HTML template is not relevant, as long as the CSS takes the placement changes in account.</p>
<p>
	The demonstration below is just a display of all product data. <strong>It is not a defined layout</strong>.
	For examples on specific displays of the product block and its style, please check the "Product catalog" or the "Product Sheet" components.

<p>Note that this component uses the HTML5 element <code>article</code>. If your site uses the XHTML DOCTYPE, just replace the HTML5 element by a <code>div</code>.</p>
