<p>Use a block quotation whenever you have to quote a phrase or a passage from a book, poem, play, paper, etc., 
	in order to illustrate succinctly or support a point or an argument.</p>
<p>Notice that a block quotation is needed whenever your quote exceeds four lines of text. Use the <span class="i-code">&lt;q&gt;</span> inline tag otherwise to quote 
	simple, short passages.</p>
<p>Remember that it is important to indicate the source of your quote. In doing so, you 
	may use the <span class="i-code">&lt;cite&gt;</span> tag to label the title of the work and/or its author, as shown below.</p>
