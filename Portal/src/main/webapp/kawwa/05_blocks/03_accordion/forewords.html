<p>Accordion blocks may be used whenever you have a group of blocks with content of the same nature.</p>
<p>With accordions, the user is able to open only one block at a time (opening a closed panel closes the already opened one). By default, the first block is opened on page load.</p>
<p>Remember to <strong>adjust the level of the title</strong> to the structure of your document 
	(use <a href="http://gsnedders.html5.org/outliner/">The HTML5 Outliner</a> 
	to check and finetune your document outline).</p>
