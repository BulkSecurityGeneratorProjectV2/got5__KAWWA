<p>
	If one of your input will have the <strong>required</strong> validator, the Kawwa library will
	add automatically the <strong>k-required</strong> class to the input.
</p>
<p>
	For the Radio and Checkbox Inputs, the <strong>k-required</strong> CSS class should be added to the legend element of the 
	fieldset, wrapping your radios. You have to specify this CSS class by yourself. For doing that, you should innject your component
	in the Java Class, and use the isRequired() method.
