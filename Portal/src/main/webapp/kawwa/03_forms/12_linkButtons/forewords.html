<p>Besides <span class="i-code">input</span> tags, you may use links to perform javascript actions in a form. 
This option may be used with caution though, as it may not be a fully accessible choice.</p>
<p>To indicate that a link is to be interpreted as a form button, you must give it the "k-button" class and it <strong>must</strong> 
be part of a list (of ".k-buttons-bar" class).</p>
<p>You may combine the "k-button" class with the following other classes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>class "optional": to secondary valid actions</li>
	<li>class "reset": to reset actions</li>
</ul>
<p>Mouseover the buttons to check "<strong>:hover</strong>" styles</p>
