<p>
	The ReponsiveMainNav Tapestry Component will insert automatically the JavaScript code for you. You just
	have to define a parameter block for the items parameter, containing your items.
	You have also two other block parameters (skip and control), if you want to redefine the rendering of these 
	two elements (They have a default rendering).
