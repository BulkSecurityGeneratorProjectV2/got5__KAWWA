Autocomplete can be customized to work with various data sources, by just specifying the source option. You must replace the variable given to the 
	<span class="i-code">createAutoComplete</span> function by your own data file path (relative to the HTML page).<br />
	For more information about this plug-in, its options, events and methods, see the
