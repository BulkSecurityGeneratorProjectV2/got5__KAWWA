<p>Tab navigation is one of the most successful metaphors we can find in web interface and it is widely used today.</p>
<p>In spite of being user-friendly, there are some few points you should consider before using tabs:</p>
<ul>
	<li>tabbed structures should be used to alternate between views <strong>within the same context</strong> (the user can easily identify a distinct group of content)</li>
	<li>tabs are a <strong>parellel navigation</strong> in nature (the content of each tab share a same level of content type)</li>
	<li><strong>tab labels should be short</strong>, so they can be easily scannable</li>
	<li>as to any other form of navigation, <strong>avoid having too much tab entries</strong> (a maximum of nine tabs would be acceptable)</li>
</ul>
