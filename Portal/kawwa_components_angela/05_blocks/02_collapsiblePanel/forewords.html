<p>You may use collapsible panels whenever you need to group content of the same nature <strong>but</strong> when this content, 
once hidden, do not interfere to the overall understanding of the general page content. Instead, 
it allows the user to get a better view of another portion of the page.</p>
<p>While with accordions the user is able to open only one panel at a time (opening a closed panel closes the already opened one), with 
			collapsible panels the user may open as many panels she wants (opening a closed panel won't close an already opened one).</p>
