	The DateField component come from the Tapesry framework, but with the jQuery UI Javascript file. 
	So, you will have the same behavior as the original one. 
</p>
<p>
    NB: Those components belong to the tapestry5-jquery project, please have a look to <a href="http://tapestry5-jquery.com/core/docsdatefield">the official website.</a>

	If you want to override the JSONObject of the jQuery UI widget, you need to use 
	the CustomDatepicker mixin, provided by the Tapestry5-jQuery project. This mixin
	has just one JSONObject-type parameter <strong>params</strong>, which correspond
	to the parameters of the jQuery UI widget.  You will find more information on the
	Tapestry5-jQuery website : http://tapestry5-jquery.com/docs/mixins/customdatepicker
